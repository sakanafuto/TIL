# Today I Learned

A summary of learning outputs of what I have learned today.
I disribe the key point and the technical articles referred to.
More concerned with committing what I have learned to memory than the appearance of the page.

## Getting Started

```shell
$ npm init -y
$ npm add -D prettier

$ brew install lefthook
$ lefthook install
```
